# Crypto Dash

Welcome to Crypto Dash! 

I've created Crypto Dash to easily keep track of different crypto currency coins and tokens. 
It doesn't require any server to run, you just download the HTML file and open it in your browser. 
Currently only Chrome, Edge and Firefox are supported. 

I want to give thanks to all the open source projects that are currently used in this project:

Bootstrap 5
Tom-Select 
Muuri JS
